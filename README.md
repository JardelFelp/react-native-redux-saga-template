## Structure

The project was created based on the folder structure of `Atomic Design`.

```
└─── components
│   └─── atoms
│   └─── molecules
│   └─── organisms
│   └─── templates
└─── pages
```

To save and manipulate the state of the application, we used `redux` and `saga`

For communication with the API we used the `axios`

## Best Practices

For best practices control we used eslint and prettier configuration files
